# Spain-Electricity-Shortfall-Case-Study: Utilizing Machine Learning (AI) for Daily Shortfall Predictions

# Context
The government of Spain is actively exploring opportunities to expand its renewable energy infrastructure investments. To ensure successful implementation, it is vital to have precise forecasts of energy shortfalls. This project is specifically designed to meet this requirement by conducting a comprehensive analysis of Spain's renewable energy sources and fossil fuel energy generation. By delving into the data and uncovering meaningful patterns, we aim to generate valuable insights and accurate predictions. These insights will serve as a solid foundation for making well-informed decisions that drive the progress of the renewable energy sector in Spain.
